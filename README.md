# Growth
*How we communicate who we are.*

This is a collection of strategies, methodologies, opinions, tools, and [resources](https://github.com/pinpt/growth/blob/master/resources.md) that we can use to help us simply communicate who we are to those that do not currently know.

Naturally, all of this aligns directly with our [mission and values](https://github.com/pinpt/handbook/blob/master/0-introduction.md).

## Strategy

This will be a little bit of a hodge-podge until we formalize our strategies and systems, but, we've been building an organic community [since Day 1](https://blog.pinpt.co/marketing-day-one/). It has centered mostly around helping folks encounter and understand who we are and the problem(s) we are ultimately trying to solve for them (remember, our mission is to *help companies build better software*).

As we've done customer research and discovery activities we've iterated on our messaging and currently talk about what we do as follows:

**What We Do:** Pinpoint instruments systems of record to provide automatic, real-time insight into the return on your software delivery investments.

In terms of execution, we are currently using the following tools and services to communicate publicly:

1. Twitter: [@WhatIsPinpoint](http://twitter.com/whatispinpoint)
2. Blog: [blog.pinpt.co](https://blog.pinpt.co/) (Subscribe for updates)
3. #EngOps Newsletter: [EngOps.is](http://engops.is/)
4. LinkedIn: [PinPT Inc](https://www.linkedin.com/company-beta/16164522/)
5. Facebook: [Pinptco](https://www.facebook.com/pinptco/)
6. Instagram: [@Pinptco](https://www.instagram.com/pinptco/)
7. Angel List: [@Pinpt](https://angel.co/pinpt)
8. Google+: [Pinpoint](https://plus.google.com/117342917449995386258)
9. CrunchBase: [Pinpoint](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/pinpoint-5)

The first 3 (Twitter, Newsletter, Blog) are the ones that are being used the most, updated weekly with fresh content. LinkedIn and Angel List are also used and we'd love for you to add us there if you'd like. The others are either passive (they are outlets where we share news, updates, and posts) through simple automation. 

We also do not use any free or paid services to coordinate release of content or updates or any analytics (outside of native solutions, like Twitter analytics). Most of our systems and processes right now are entirely manual. But it's worth noting that the newsletter and blog are paid services (Curated SaaS app, WPEngine blog hosting).
